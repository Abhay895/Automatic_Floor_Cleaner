## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Startup**: Arduino initializes sensors and motors.
2. **Obstacle Detection**: Ultrasonic sensors measure distance to nearby objects.
3. **Path Planning**: Robot turns or reverses upon detecting obstacles.
4. **Cleaning**: Simultaneous floor cleaning using brush or mop setup.
5. **Loop**: The robot continues this loop until manually turned off or battery runs out.
